# Stack and Queue with Max (C++)

Implementation of a stack and a queue data structure that support constant-time maximum value queries. Developed as part of the “Estructuras de Datos” (ED) course at the University of Granada.

## 📦 Features

- `MaxStack`: a custom stack that supports retrieving the maximum value in O(1)
- `MaxQueue`: a custom queue with the same property
- Efficient use of auxiliary structures (e.g. secondary stacks)
- Modular and reusable C++ code

## 🛠️ Technologies
- C++
- Standard Template Library (STL)
- Terminal-based execution and testing

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run
  ```bash
  
  ```
